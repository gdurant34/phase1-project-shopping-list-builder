      "name": "Coconut Pepita Maple Granola",
      "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C) and line a baking tray. In a large bowl, mix together the oats, almonds, seeds, and coconut. Pour the maple syrup, coconut oil, and salt over the oat mixture and toss it to coat. Transfer to the baking tray and bake on the centre rack of the oven for 60 - 70 minutes*, or until lightly golden. Stir every 15 - 20 minutes. When removed from the oven, let cool completely. It will continue to harden as it cools. If adding any dried fruits, stir it in now, then transfer the granola to an airtight container or large glass storage jar. Enjoy!",
